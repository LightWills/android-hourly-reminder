# How To Translate

To translate hourly reminder to your language you need to translate following files:

  * [pref_settings.xml](app/src/main/res/xml/pref_settings.xml)
  * [pref_reminders.xml](app/src/main/res/xml/pref_reminders.xml)
  * [strings.xml](app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml)

In additional, you need to figure it out, which is the best way to pronounce current time.
