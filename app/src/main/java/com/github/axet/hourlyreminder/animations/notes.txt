Here some thing about animations issues.

First:

If your animation touches some elements, then hide them (GONE), some properties may not be
recalculated because element is hidden.

Here is no solution. You have to restore all properties of evey view which may be affected by
running animation to its initial state.

If you dont you may see routated (setRotate) or hidded (setAlpha) elements even if endAnimation()
restore thier initial states (do setRotate(0) or setApha(1) do not make them not rotated or
visible).


Second:

On normal run we have onAnimationEnd() is not final call applyTransformation() called after that.

applyTransformation()
onAnimationEnd()
applyTransformation()

On animation cancel we have:
applyTransformation()
onAnimationEnd()

Which makes unpredictable where do we have to finish animation with initial values on top of first
statement.
